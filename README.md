<h1 align="center">PathFinderX: Path Planning with Bidirectional A* Algorithm</h1>

### INTRODUCTION<hr>
- Path planning is crucial in robotics for safe navigation. It involves finding the best route from a start to a goal while avoiding obstacles.
- Bidirectional A*
  - A pathfinding algorithm widely used in robotics for efficient path planning.
  - simultaneously explores from start and goal nodes to find the shortest path efficiently.
  - offers advantages such as reduced computational complexity and guaranteed optimality
- Our project aims to implement and assess Bidirectional A* for robotic path planning, focusing on efficiency and optimality.



### OBJECTIVES<hr>
- Explore path planning algorithms, especially A* algorithm.
- Develop a robust implementation of the Bidirectional A* algorithm for efficient path planning in robotics.
- Assess efficiency, optimality, and scalability compared to traditional algorithms.
- Showcase practical benefits in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.
