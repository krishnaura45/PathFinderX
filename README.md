### INTRODUCTION<hr>
- Path planning is crucial in robotics for safe navigation. It involves finding the best route from a start to a goal while avoiding obstacles.
- Bidirectional A*
  - A pathfinding algorithm widely used in robotics for efficient path planning.
  - simultaneously explores from start and goal nodes to find the shortest path efficiently.
  - offers advantages such as reduced computational complexity and guaranteed optimality
- Our project aims to implement and assess Bidirectional A* for robotic path planning, focusing on efficiency and optimality.
